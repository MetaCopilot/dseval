person buying alcohol looks under 25, they will be challenged for id to prove they're of age. - paige, @tesco maybe hire colleagues who can see?, @tesco the point is if it's enforced they do it properly or they don't. plus take some common-sense and think does that person look over 18?, @105855 hi thomas, this is correct but this helps our store colleagues judge age and protect them from making underage sales. amanda, @tesco uk offlicense law is 18. not 25, @105855 hi thomas, we operate a think 25 policy at our stores. i'd be flattered to be id'd. :-) - helena, got id's @tesco for buying one adnams broadside. is being blind part of the job-spec? i am 35 and 99 kilos., @105856 hi there, could you try deleting your cache and cookies and reinstalling the app if using it? this

slots for the next 3 weeks, which i find slightly unlikely., @105856 hi there, as long as you sign out of your account prior to deleting your cache &amp; cookies, you'll still have a full basket :)
